Current working directory, musings and code snips while
working with _Thinking Forth_ example code.

No attempt has been made to integrate what is already
stored as TURNKEY on the working example target.

The 'newchar>' word replaces the '_' Dr. Ting chose for
non-printables, with the more traditional '.' (dot, 0x2E).

The 'eflogo' word updates to specific eForth version,
when telling the Lumex display what it is.

END.
