organizing the turnkey

The TURNKEY imaging system allows incremental development.

However, it then becomes a bit complex, to trace what is
exactly on the target board, as its current TURNKEY image,
as compared with what is held as source code, on the host
PC used to develop the forth code (mainly by providing full
text editor environment, and ASCII upload to the target).
